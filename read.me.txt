Hello and Welcome to my Entrepenurial Project. 

To run this application, please read the following steps: 

Note: Please do NOT run this application on the following dates. This is because the API is updating, and data cannot be returned.

Saturday 11th May 11am-2pm
Tuesday 14th May 6:30pm-9:30pm
Sunday 19th May 2:30pm - 


I am unsure what happens to this API after the 19th May. Typically it is removed for the new season.
This means the application will not showcase its full functionality from the 19th May - September 2024, due to it aligning with the premier league season.


Steps: 

1) Save the file to your computer. 
This has been tested thoroughly through the windows operating system. 
This might take a while due to the shear amount of files. So bare with the download, sorry! 

2) Open the command prompt on your computer. 

3) Type the following in the command prompt, in order. 

- cd C:\Users\ellis\OneDrive\Desktop\fpl_app

(Of course, this will depend on the route to your saved file).
(In this case, I have saved it to my one drive desktop)
(Please also ensure the file is named fpl_app when you have extracted the zip, and all the routes are correct)
(ie. file path = fpl_app > templates > menu.html. The file names should have no extra routes)

- venv\Scripts\activate

- python app.py

- Run the executable on http://127.0.0.1:5000 on your browser. For maximum compatibility, use Google Chrome. 

If you get errors, please ensure the following libraries are installed:

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, session, flash
import requests
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import joblib 
import os
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

If you need a passkey, please use the following: app.secret_key = 'temp'.

This should effectively run the application!
(If you have any issues, please feel free to email me. 

Files included:

fpl_app > static, templates, venv, app.py, train_model.py > player_model.

Each of the files listed above should have adequate files installed inside.
